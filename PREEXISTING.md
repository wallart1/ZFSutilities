- (toolchain deprecation, docs build): `mkdocs build -f docs/mkdocs.yml`
  prints a mkdocs-material WARNING — "MkDocs 2.0 is incompatible with
  Material for MkDocs" — on every build (exit 0, site still builds cleanly).
  Action is a toolchain decision (pin mkdocs <2 vs migrate to Zensical),
  already analyzed in SESSION_NOTES.md's Zensical thread; recorded here so
  it can be prompted for a decision. Not resolved (code freeze).
  Zensical is under development. We are waiting for a 1.x.x release.
