# SESSION_NOTES.md

Session notes, progress notes, and notes to myself. Per the root `AGENTS.md`
Hard Rules, these live here — never in AGENTS.md (which is user-owned). I
maintain this file and remove obsolete entries as work evolves: an entry is
obsolete once its cycle is committed, durable knowledge belongs in `docs/`
or PREEXISTING.md, and only undocumented gotchas and active threads are kept
here. Pruned history remains recoverable from git.

(2026-10-15 prune: everything through Release 0.125.0 is committed and
documented — the itf campaign, releases 0.114.0–0.125.0, and every wrap-up
entry were removed; recoverable via `git log`.)
(2026-10-16 prune: the Performance-page/alignment plan run, the blocksize
ladder, the scroll-stability work, and the zfswipe notification rework are
committed with Release 0.126.0 — their entries were removed; recoverable
via `git log`.)
(2026-10-22 prune: the 0.126.1 revert-and-redo campaign through Release
0.126.3 is committed, pushed, and released — the restore/rework/wrap-up
entries were removed; recoverable via `git log`. Live items condensed into
the threads below.)
(2026-10-22 release prune: the 0.126.3 follow-up campaign — wrap-up
usability fixes, upgrade prereq gate, rsync failure tails, CI red,
PREEXISTING resolution pass — is committed as 1e5d92e, pushed, and
released as 0.127.0; those entries were removed, recoverable via
`git log`.)
(2026-10-23 release prune: the 0.128.0 and 0.129.0 campaigns — the
unarchive-vm live-tree iSCSI rebuild + F-020..F-024 lifecycle fixes,
canmount profiles, probe-target dedupe, FHS conf precedence, both
wrap-up review passes, and the zfstestvm lun-32/33 + cron.log threads —
are committed as 3713eff/a964289, pushed, and released as v0.129.0;
those entries were removed, recoverable via `git log`. Live items
condensed into the threads below.)

## Persistent gotchas (not documented in docs/)

- `source_helper` scoping law (vm-205 incident, 2026-10-16): bashinit's
  `source_helper` is a function, so a library sourced through it runs inside
  the helper's frame — every top-level `declare` (incl. `declare -A` maps
  declared by a sourced node.conf) becomes function-local and **vanishes when
  source_helper returns**, while functions and plain assignments survive
  globally. Any library state that must outlive the source needs `declare -g`
  / `-gA` (now done in node-lib, iscsi-lib, zfslockmanager — keep it that
  way for future libs). Symptom signature: a lookup helper works when its
  orchestrator sourced the lib at top level (storage-host runs inherit the
  populated globals; the `declare -f` guards skip source_helper) but returns
  empty-map failures only in ssh-shipped payloads running in fresh shells.

- Strict-mode (`set -euo pipefail`) flip idioms (2026-10-16 wrap-up, 13
  orchestrators migrated): (1) a function whose last statement is
  `[[ cond ]] && assign` returns 1 when the condition is false — close
  with an `if` or an explicit `return 0` or callers under `-e` abort
  (discover_iscsi_state class); (2) inside `while IFS= read -r` loops
  use `[[ -n "$x" ]] || continue`, never `[[ -n "$x" ]] && append` —
  a blank input line would otherwise make the loop itself the failing
  command; (3) associative-array reads on possibly-missing keys need
  `:-` guards even inside `[[ ... ]]` — `-u` fires at expansion time;
  (4) every `$(cmd | grep | head)` whose empty result is legitimate
  (LUN "not mapped", candidate "none found", sidecar "key absent")
  needs a trailing `|| true` — under pipefail the mid-pipeline grep
  fails the substitution and `-e` turns an empty answer into an abort;
  (5) `((++var))` is safe, `((var++))` is not (returns the old value);
  (6) child-engine heredocs are non-interactive — they get the full
  trio too, while sourced libraries must never set shell options.
  Sourced bashinit/node-lib/paths run under `-u` safely (all vars have
  defaults); on_storage/on_compute's `rc=$?` capture only works because
  every caller invokes them in an `if`/`||` context (errexit is
  suppressed inside functions called from conditions).

- Backslash line-joins keep the continuation line's indent, so
  `"arg-part-a" \` + indented `"part-b"` becomes **two arguments**, not
  one concatenated string — for one-argument payloads (ssh command
  strings, sed programs) build them in a variable with `+=`.  Inside
  unquoted heredocs, `\`+newline joins with the indent intact, so
  source-wrapping payload lines only ever changes inter-word spaces.
  When verifying a heredoc edit by extraction, aim at the RIGHT block
  (files can hold several with the same marker) and keep `<<MARKER` in
  the opener, or the "payload" executes as live script (a `cd /root` +
  `set -e` block aborts harmlessly as non-root, but the check is
  vacuous — 0 rendered lines means the check proved nothing).
- The bash test harness (`tests/run-tests`) runs suites **without pipefail**,
  so a failure branch that depends on a pipeline's non-zero exit code cannot
  fire under the harness (e.g. the dry-run estimate-failure branch of
  `zfs-migrate-send`). Tests assert the reachable path instead (the
  "Unable to get stream size estimate" message).
- `tests/test-archive-vm`: `ask_yn` cannot be mocked — sourcing `archive-vm`
  re-runs bashinit via `~/bashinit`, which unconditionally redefines it — so
  dialog answers are fed via stdin in prompt order. With dependent clones
  present, the severance question is the first stdin consumer, before
  the archive-base prompt.
- `docs/docs/commands-and-modules/modules.md`: nested (lettered) sub-lists
  need 4-space indentation; at 3 spaces Python-Markdown flattens the nested
  list, which `test_docs_integrity` rejects.
- `tests/python/test_gui_infrastructure.py` `TestPageAnchorMapping` audits
  `_PAGE_ANCHORS` against the **locally built docs site**
  (`docs/site/…/gtk-gui/index.html`, untracked). Adding a page or changing
  docs anchors requires BOTH updating that test's `expected_pages` set and
  rebuilding the site (`cd docs && mkdocs build`), or the full suite fails.
- bash EXIT traps under `set -e`: any failing statement inside an EXIT-trap
  handler aborts the rest of the handler (run-tests' kill_pytest_tree had to
  `|| true` the kill/wait pair). `append_exit_trap` in `bin/bashinit` is the
  registry to use — never a bare `trap ... EXIT` (it silently clobbers any
  earlier one). Also: bash 5.2 does not fire an EXIT trap armed inside a
  bare `while read` loop that is itself a pipeline segment, and a `&`-
  launched script is SIGINT-immune (POSIX async-subshell SIG_IGN) — use
  SIGTERM to test interruption paths.
- GTK dialog modules: `gi.require_version("Gtk", "3.0")` must run BEFORE
  `from gi.repository import Gtk` — importing Gtk first pins Gdk 4.0 and
  then `gui_helpers`' `gi.require_version("Gdk", "3.0")` raises. Every
  dialog module follows the `import gi` → `require_version` → imports
  order; new ones must too.
- New gi-guarded python suites must be added to `tests/requirements.manifest`
  (`gi tests/python/<suite>.py`) — `test_gui_infrastructure` audits manifest
  ↔ guarded-suite equality and the FULL suite fails otherwise (affected
  suites alone stay green).
- Overriding a **sourced library function** in a test (e.g. `transfer_pacer`)
  and then `unset -f`-ing it DELETES the function — unlike external
  commands there is no PATH fallback. Save and restore with
  `_orig=$(declare -f fn)` … `eval "$_orig"` (0.125.0 cycle: `unset -f
  transfer_pacer` broke the two paced tests that ran after it).
- Pipeline child **startup** order is not guaranteed by bash — the scheduler
  can run any subshell first. Tests that assert stage order must record
  data-dependent markers (a downstream stage writes only after draining the
  upstream's EOF), never echo-at-entry (0.125.0 cycle: the pacer-before-pv
  order test failed ~1 run in 6 under load).
- test-lib.sh redirects `log_msg` into `$_TEST_LOG_FILE`; a `get_log()`
  helper is NOT provided by test-lib — it is defined per-suite
  (test-transfer-lib, test-zfs-migrate-send). In suites without it, assert
  against `cat "${_TEST_LOG_FILE}"`.
- Docs viewer: it picks its site ONCE at window construction — rebuilding
  the repo site does not fix an already-open window; the browser/
  desktop-handler openmd flow still receives paths baked at `mkdocs build`
  time (edit_links.py unchanged — relative baking would break the handler).
  Deployed launches resolve through `current`, so a versions/<v>-baked URL
  re-anchors to `current` and survives version switches.

- `tests/test-module-dependencies` now scans `bin/` and `lib/` too (was
  repo-root-only, i.e. vacuous — the repo root has no loose scripts). New
  scripts must resolve every called function through a direct `source`,
  `source_helper`, a `find_zfsutility_script` reference, or a variable
  assignment feeding `source "$var"`; `declare -f <fn>` guards mark a
  function as an optional caller-provided dependency (the
  zfslockmanager→node-lib pattern). The scanner masks multi-line quoted
  strings and comment tails, so python `-c` payloads and `# ... (send base)`
  comments are not mistaken for bash calls.

## Active / parked threads

- **unarchive-vm 205 production rerun: EXECUTED 2026-10-23 21:24 —
  0.129.0 machinery validated LIVE.** Step-1 skip verified (3×);
  stewie node.conf converged to iqn.2026-02.local.stewie (backup
  node.conf.bak-20261023T212411); tweety already converged; disks
  mapped onto live targets at existing LUNs (disk3→1/nvme1,
  disk0→11, disk1→12/threeamigos); safe-iscsi-save 36/36 + manifest
  regen + boot config; Step-4 discovery + login (2 sessions) + rescan
  (118 devices). Residual WARNs (expected): Step 3 kept scsi0/scsi3
  by-path lines verbatim — THIS archive predates the F-021 matcher
  fix, so its sidecars carry no DISK_KEY and key_to_disknum is empty;
  the rewrite branch (which j07 proves for new archives) never fired.
  Pre-boot check for the user: in the PVE GUI confirm the kept lines'
  LUNs match the mapping above. efidisk0 also kept — its zvol was not
  in the archive (only disks 0/1/3), so the reference may point at
  missing storage; PVE aborts VM start on a missing disk (known
  hazard class). Possible future improvement: for legacy sidecars
  without DISK_KEY, derive the key→disknum association from the
  line's original (target, LUN) via the LIO lun→backstore map.

- **Guest-probe future work (validation COMPLETE 2026-10-23):** surface
  sample.pve_failure inside the Alignment view when VM layers are
  missing.

- **0.126.1-revert residue (user decisions pending).** /var/lib/zfsutilities
  holds pool_activity.json + scrub_state.json.20261020T163711.bak from the
  brief repo-GUI run — the scrub queue comes up empty until the .bak is
  restored; two dangling ~/.config symlinks from the migration-sweep
  incident remain. The aborted pool-activity campaign lives only on branch
  `archive/pre-revert-20261020` (07010d6).

- **Zvol-snapshot-mount plan v3 (2026-10-01) — parked, NOT approved.** Plan
  written next to v1/v2 in
  `/NFS1/dan(NFS1)/zfsutilities-plan/Plans in abeyance/Zvol-snapshot-mount/`.
  Base is v2's architecture plus four fixes: (1) the archive-vm guard must
  scan raw discovery output (Pass 1 drops the archived VM's own clones — the
  natural browse-then-archive case); (2) promote-vm-clone marker skip in all
  four awk blocks; (3) migration pre-flight on source AND destination pools
  (receive uses -F); (4) reuse the shipped `parent_type` field + refreshed
  line numbers. Implementation notes: dataset-component-only marker test in
  buildfsarray; wait for the clone's /dev/zvol node before loop_attach.
  Shipped behavior until approved: volume-snapshot mounts rejected with WARN
  + disabled Mount button; no clone-based volume-snapshot mounting (user
  decision).

- **Zensical vs MkDocs evaluation (2026-10-02) — research only, no code
  changed.** User asked whether Zensical (zensical.org, the Material-team
  successor SSG; note spelling, not "Zensicle") can replace MkDocs here.
  Answer: functionally yes at 0.0.67 — verified by pip-installing zensical in
  a scratch venv and building a copy of the real docs: clean build, page set
  identical to mkdocs output (32/32 HTML), build time on par (~7.5 s), and
  the pip install is self-contained (no mkdocs-material needed; classic
  Material theme built in). The two custom hooks are the only functional
  gap, and both have config-only replacements, verified: `hooks:` is silently
  ignored by zensical, so (a) version_stamp.py → `extra.version: !ENV VAR`
  (footer rendered "ZFS Utilities v…"); (b) edit_links.py → `repo_url:
  openmd:/` + `edit_uri: /<abs path>/docs/docs/` yields byte-identical
  openmd:// URIs (MkDocs itself rejects a non-http repo_url, so that config
  becomes zensical-only; side effect: a "Go to repository" header icon
  pointing at the docs dir; the absolute path is machine-specific, unlike the
  hook's dynamic derivation). Mermaid: `<pre class="mermaid">` fences render
  and the mermaid runtime is inlined in bundle.js (not browser-verified).
  pymdownx.details is configured in mkdocs.yml but unused in content (zero
  `???` blocks). If migrating, use `theme.variant: classic` for Material
  look parity. Migration surface beyond docs/: bin/startdocserver (build/
  serve invocations `zensical build --clean` / `zensical serve -a 0.0.0.0:8000`,
  plus exporting the !ENV version), bin/check-prerequisites (mkdocs<2 pin
  logic), lib/installer-lib.sh, share/dev/install-test-deps.sh, and tests/
  {test-startdocserver, test-deploy-version, test-installer-checks,
  test-check-prerequisites, python/test_support.py}. Holding back: still
  0.0.x with releases every few days — expect breaking changes before 1.0.


## 2026-10-23 (late) — ITF cycle: journey --rerun + j08/j09 + discoverability (uncommitted)

- `itf journey run NAME --rerun`: driver resolves the newest non-active
  same-journey run with guest records → rerun-guests.tsv; the
  stage_from_template rerun branch rolls each guest back to as-cloned
  (verifying presence + checkpoint), re-discovers IP/ssh, and the journey
  replays in full — only the template clone is skipped. Stale snapshots
  newer than as-cloned are delsnapshotted first (qm rollback KEEPS them
  on this stack; the replay's same-name re-snapshot would collide).
  Live-verified: j04 7m24s→2m04s, j07 21m16s→8m09s; both reruns fully
  green; lab guests destroyed after. Traps hit live: listsnapshot name
  is $2 (arrow is $1); the driver's own new run dir must be filtered
  from the source-run glob (it reads "running"); `[[ a == b ]] ||
  continue` KEEPS the equal case — the inverted guard broke that filter.
- j08-prereq-decline + j09-prereq-apt-failure journeys (installer failure
  paths): itf_journey_run_installer gained [expected-rc];
  stage_install factored into prepare_install + install so the failure
  journeys share tooling/download/check. j09 breaks apt via a dead-proxy
  drop-in (deterministic; removed + verified healing at the end). Both
  assert graceful rc-1 abort, the exact user-facing message, and a
  deployment-free guest. NOT yet run live (first runs pending; they need
  a fresh stage_os install each).
- Docs: itf README roadmap Phase 3→complete + 3.5 row; journeys/README
  rerun contract + j06–j09 rows (j06/j07 rows were missing) + j01 row
  trimmed to actual scope; dev-guide "Fast re-verification" section;
  tests/AGENTS.md gained the itf discoverability section. Site rebuilt.
- test-itf-driver: +8 rerun tests (subprocess refusals/spec-writing via
  sandboxed ITF_RUNS_DIR + in-process rollback-branch units), 21 total.
- Full suite green (98 suites). Everything above is uncommitted on top
  of 0.129.0 (a964289).

## 2026-10-23 (latest) — ITF todo 1: stage_os rerun (uncommitted, on top of the above)

- `itf_journey_stage_os` gained the `--rerun` branch mirroring
  stage_from_template: resolve the guest from rerun-guests.tsv, presence
  + os-installed checkpoint gates, stale-snapshot sweep, rollback, IP/ssh
  re-discovery. j08/j09 iterations skip the ~15–20 min Debian install.
- stage_os-specific trap: the rollback RESTORES the os-installed
  snapshot's VM config, which still carries the installer-time freeze:1
  (only the paired resume ever unfroze it) — so the `set --freeze 0`
  clear must sit BETWEEN rollback and start (a pre-rollback clear
  reverts with the config). Clones hit the same inherited flag via
  itf_guest_clone; here it needed its own step.
- Driver wording generalized (as-cloned / os-installed) in itf usage
  header + rerun-source INFO step; docs updated (tests/AGENTS.md, itf
  README quick-start, journeys/README rerun section, dev-guide Fast
  re-verification).
- test-itf-driver: +2 stage_os tests (rerun rollback ordering incl.
  rollback→freeze-clear→start law; fresh-path dispatch). j08 first live
  run launched (validates the journey as authored + seeds the
  os-installed checkpoint); j08 --rerun live verification follows.
- Live verification (zfstestvm1): j08 fresh 14m03s PASSED (also the
  journey's first-ever live run — validates it as authored, seeds
  os-installed); j08 --rerun 1m37s PASSED, all six rerun-branch steps
  green (presence, checkpoint, rollback, freeze clear, start, IP/ssh —
  same IP rediscovered, proving the guest actually booted unfrozen).
  Lab guest 8001 destroyed after verification.
